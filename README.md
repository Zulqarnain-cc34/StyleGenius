## Overview

StyleGenius is a project that aims to make a recommender system using the data about customer, articles and transactions. The dataset is available here on kaggle [H&M Recommendation](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations) is a dataset used in machine learning to predict whether an image of a skin lesion is melanoma or not. The dataset contains a total of 33,126 images of skin lesions, where 32,312 are benign and 814 are malignant.

## Goals

1. Collect data and conduct data analysis. Visual reports.  
 
2. Evaluate ClassificaAon Models (Decision Trees, Random Forests, Linear Regression) with Deep Learning Models (CNN, RNN etc) and based on the outcome Design and implement one or more deep learning systems, experiment with various algorithms to maximise the learning capability. Evaluate the performance and document findings.   
 
3. Cost funcAons should be carefully thought through and jusAfied. 
 
4. Final Model ‚Äì Able to predict accurately the products that the customer is going to purchase based on previous purchases
